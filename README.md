An alternative to phing's default pearpkg2

This package provides an alternative to phing's bundled pearpkg2, allowing for
a build script that more closely resembles a real package.xml2.0 file or using
the API that is available by using PEAR_PackageFileManager2.

This package can be installed via pear, from the CakePHP PEAR channel:

 # pear channel-discover pear.cakephp.org

 # pear install cakephp/Phing_d51PearPkg2Task
